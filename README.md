# Software-Quality-Prediction
The quality of software can be best assessed by the use of software metrics. In practice, software quality mainly refers to reliability, maintainability, and understandability. 
A number of metrics have been proposed by researchers and practitioners to evaluate the quality of software. The usefulness of these metrics lies in their ability to predict the reliability of the developed software. 
Reliability is generally measured by the number of faults found in the developed software. Software fault prediction is a challenging task for researchers before the software is released. Hence, accurate fault prediction is one of the major goals so as to release a software having the least possible faults.
The project explores the use of applying Reinforcement learning-based technique to accurately predict the number of software defects.
